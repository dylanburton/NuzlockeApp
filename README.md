The app currently is being placed together. 
App is for keeping track of pokemon for nuzlocking within the game red and blue.
It is capable of creating playthroughs to help track the game, and if the game has been randomized,
it will display what moves each pokemon will likely know.
It is mostly for soul link nuzlockes, although it will be useful for regular playthroughs.
